This is a home page, which may or may not be filled in later. This website contains the bulk of my computer science notes, and I hope it's useful to you. I poured hundreds of hours into this project and I'm proud to share it. On the left, you will see a directory of files. Notes are sorted by Year > Semester > Class > Topic. If there are any mistakes in my notes, please [let me know](https://github.com/benjitusk/Computer-Science-Notes/issues/new/choose). Thanks, and good luck!

Unfortunately, due to the HTML export engine I am using, this page will likely not work on mobile. If you have this issue, visit this site on a device with a wider screen, like a tablet or computer.

> [!bug] Browsing this website with Safari
I've noticed that there are some $\text{strange rendering issues}$ when viewing this website with Safari. These issues only affect the "fancy math text" portions of the document, but unfortunately for Safari users, that constitutes a great deal of these notes. It seems like Google Chrome is working well, so if you are having issues, please try another browser.
