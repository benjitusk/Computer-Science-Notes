This is a home page, which may or may not be filled in later. This website contains the bulk of my computer science notes, and I hope it's useful to you. I poured hundreds of hours into this project and I'm proud to share it. On the left, you will see a directory of files. Notes are sorted by Year > Semester > Class > Topic. If there are any mistakes in my notes, please [let me know](https://github.com/benjitusk/Computer-Science-Notes/issues/new/choose). Thanks, and good luck!
