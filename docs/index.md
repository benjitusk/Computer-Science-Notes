Hi! Thanks for checking out my notes. This is a project that I’ve poured many hours into, and I’m very proud to share my notes with you from all of my classes at Machon Lev. Please note, that the latest folders are still a **work in progress**. They are not complete, and will be updated shortly.

> Please note that Safari does not display $\text{math expressions}$ properly. If some words in the previous sentence look bumpy or wavy, you are likely affected by this issue. Unfortunately, this is beyond my control, and I recommend switching to another browser if it causes the notes to become unreadable. This is **not** something I intend to fix or do any more research on.

If there are any mistakes in my notes, please [let me know](https://github.com/benjitusk/Computer-Science-Notes/issues/new/choose). Thanks, and good luck!
