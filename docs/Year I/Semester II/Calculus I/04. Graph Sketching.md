##### Definition:
$x_0$ is an <u>extreme point</u> of $f$ if there exists a neighborhood  of $x_0$, $I=(x_0-\epsilon, x_0+\epsilon)$ such that either $f(x_0) > f(x)\;\forall x\in I$ or $f(x_0) < f(x)\;\forall x\in I$ $[x\not=x_0]$
In the first case, $x_0$ is a <u>local maximum</u>; in the second case, $x_0$ is a <u>local minimum</u>.

##### Fermat's Theorem (#36)
> [!quote] Theorem
> If $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$, and $x_0$ is an extreme point of $f$, then $f^\prime(x_0)=0$
> ###### Caveats:
> 1. Note the condition $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$:
>	- $f$ can have an extreme point where f is not differentiable.
>	  Ex.: $f(x)=|x|$
> 2. Not every point where $f^\prime=0$ is an extreme point. (i.e., the converse of Fermat's theorem is not true.)

##### Critical points
By Fermat's Theorem, the only *candidates* for extreme points of $f$ are points where
1. $f^\prime(x)=0$
2. $f$ is not differentiable at $x_0$
If $x_0$ satisfies either of these conditions, then $x_0$ is a <u>critical point</u> of $f$.

##### Rolle's Theorem
> [!quote] Theorem
> Suppose $f$ is continuous in $[a,b]$ and differentiable in $(a,b)$, with $f(a)=f(b)$. Then $\exists c\in(a,b)\mid f^\prime(c)=0$

##### Mean Value Theorem (MVT)
> [!quote] Theorem
> Suppose $f$ is continuous in $[a,b]$ and differentiable in $(a,b)$. Then, $\exists c\in(a,b)\mid f^\prime(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$
> Practically speaking, there exists at least one point on $f$ between $(a,b)$ where the slope of the tangent is exactly equal to the slope of the line between $a$ and $b$.
> You can think of this as a "sideways" version of Rolle's Theorem.
> ##### Corollaries of MVT:
> 1. If $f^\prime(x)=0$ for all $x\in(a,b)$, then $f$ is constant.
> 2. Let $f,g$ be continuous on $[a,b]$, and differentiable on $(a, b)$. If $f^\prime(x)=g^\prime(x)\mid\forall x\in(a,b)$, then they differ by a constant (i.e. $g(x)=f(x)+k$ for some constant k on all of $(a,b)$)
> 3. If $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $f^\prime(x)>0\mid\forall x\in(a,b)$ then f is increasing on $(a,b)$.
> 	- If $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $f^\prime(x)<0\mid\forall x\in(a,b)$ then f is decreasing on $(a,b)$.
> 	- $f$ is increasing $\iff f^\prime(x)>0$
> 	- $f$ is decreasing $\iff f^\prime(x)<0$
> 4. Linear Approximation:
> 	For h small, $f(x_0+h)\approx f(x_0)+h\cdot f^\prime (x_0)$
> 	See: [[03. Differentiability and Derivatives#Linear Approximation using derivatives|Explanation]]


##### Sketching graph using information about $f^\prime$
Ex.: $f(x)=x^3-6x^2+9x$
We wish to find extreme points where $f$ is increasing and where $f$ is decreasing.
1. Find critical points (where $f^\prime=0$ **or** $f$ is not differentiable)
	- $f$ is a polynomial, so it's differentiable for all $x$
	- $f^\prime(x)=3x^2-12x+9=0$ (set it to be zero to find extreme points)
		- $f^\prime(x)=3(x^2-4x+3)=0$
		- $f^\prime(x)=3(x^2-4x+3)=0$
		- $f^\prime(x)=3(x-1)(x-3)=0$
	- Critical points are $1, 3$
2. Examine critical points
	1. First derivative test:
		1. For local maximum, $f^\prime(x<x_0)<0<f^\prime(x>x_0)$
		   For local minimum, $f^\prime(x<x_0)>0>f^\prime(x>x_0)$
		2.  Check the signs of the derivative function using the snake method
			- ![[Graph Sketching 2023-06-13 14.34.57.excalidraw]]
		3. $f^\prime>0\mid x<1,x>3$
		    $f^\prime<0\mid1<x<3$
		4. $x_0=1$ is a local max
		    $x_0=3$ is a local min
	2. $2^{nd}$ method to locate extreme  points (from the critical points):
		1. Look at the second derivative $f^{\prime\prime}(x_0)$ where $x_0$ is a critical point
		2. If $f^{\prime\prime}(x_0) > 0$ then $x_0$ is a local min
		3. If $f^{\prime\prime}(x_0)<0$ then $x_0$ is a local max
		4. If $f^{\prime\prime}(x_0)<0$ then this test gives no information
		- In our example, $f^{\prime\prime}(x)=6x-12$, so we check:
			- $f^{\prime\prime}(1)=-6$, so it's a local maximum
			- $f^{\prime\prime}(3)=6$, so it's a local minimum
3. Sketch the graph
	1. Plot the points where the graph intersect the X-axis
	2. Plot the maxima and minima
	3. connect them using information gleaned from examination of critical points.
