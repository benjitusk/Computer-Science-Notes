There are three important control lines for memory chips:
- CS â€” Chip Select (or chip enable)
- OE â€” Output Enable (or read enable)
- WE â€” Write Enable

These are important parameters for all memory systems:
- Capacity â€” How much data can be stored by the system
- Access Time â€” This is defined differently for different systems
	- Random Access
		- ![[8. Memory 2023-07-11 17.01.44.excalidraw]]
		- Defined as the time elapsed from when the MAR gives the address to Memory until the data is ready in the MIR
	- Sequential Access (not relevant i think)
		- Defined as the time elapsed from when the data 
- Data Rate â€” how many bits per second can be read. usually for sequential access
- Cycle Time â€” Minimum amount of time the processor must wait between the starts of two consecutive memory accesses. This is not the same as access time.
	- Cycle Time = Access Time + Recovery Time + Transient Time
		- Recovery Time: Time needed for the data to be electrically stable
		- Transient Time: Time needed to â€˜rechargeâ€™ the voltage in the transistors that store data

## SRAM
The size of an SRAM with $m$ address lines (as in, the address is $m$ bits long) and $n$ data lines (as in, each â€˜wordâ€™ is $n$ bits) is $2^m\times n$ bits. For example, if an SRAM has 11 address lines (thus, a capacity of $2^{11}=2048$ bits) and an $8$ bit word, the capacity is $16,384$ bits, or 2 KiB.

An SRAM Chip looks like this:
![[8. Memory 2023-07-11 17.56.27.excalidraw]]
CE, WE, and RE are all active low, which means in order to activate that line, you must set the bit to 0.

CE|WE|RE|Chip Mode
-|-|-|-
1|X|X|No Access
0|0|1|Read Mode
0|1|0|Write Mode

### 1D Layout of SRAM
1D Layout of SRAM looks like this:
![[8. Memory 2023-07-11 18.31.38.excalidraw]]
Each output line is connected to the output of an AND gate of the entry in memory with the decoder output.
![[8. Memory 2023-07-11 18.45.44.excalidraw]]
The output of all these AND gates get OR-ed together and results in the memory value at the requested address.

### 2D SRAM Layout
This layout works by splitting the data across multiple memory segments, and using a MUX to choose which segment output to pass on:

The slides *suck*. Thereâ€™s just too much fluff to actually figure out what we need to know, and whatâ€™s important. Iâ€™m coming back to this, but if you have notes on this section, *please PM me* on WhatsApp. Thanks! ðŸ˜‰
