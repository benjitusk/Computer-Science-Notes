# Sheini
- All the men and all the women got super excited and ran to grab lots and lots of stuff. Here’s a sneak peek at what they brought in:
	- Any gold, silver, or copper that they could find
	- Turquoise, purple, and scarlet wool
	- red dyed ram skins, goats hair, and tachash skins
	- Shittim wood (even those who didn’t have any helped those who did to bring)
	- Beautiful tapestries woven by the women out of the wool and linen and goats hair
	- Shoham Stones (by the princes)
		- they didn’t jump on the opportunity to donate, they were content to fill in whatever was missing. Therefore, all they could contribute were these stones
		- This is a very important lesson to take! Don’t let the chance to do *mitzvot* pass by. Every opportunity to do a *mitzva* is invaluable and should not be taken for granted. There are only so many minutes we have left on this world, and we don’t even know how many we have. It’s incumbent upon us to maximize the time we have on this world and not let any circumstance to to a *mitzva* pass us by.
