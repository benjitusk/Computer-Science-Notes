# About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Benji Tusk, I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at Machon Lev, a part of the Jerusalem College of Technology. I'm the lead frontend developer and one of the founders of ScheduLearn, a schedule builder for schools. I'm a huge fan of reading, rollerblading, swimming, and the Oxford comma ðŸ˜‰. I've been programming since 2012, and my skillset includes SwiftUI, Python, TSX, AWS, Flutter, and some other cool stuff.
