# About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Benji Tusk, I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at Machon Lev, a part of the Jerusalem College of Technology.I'm the lead frontend developer and one of the founders of ScheduLearn, a schedule solver for schools. I'm a huge fan of reading, rollerblading, swimming, and the Oxford comma ðŸ˜‰. I've been programming since 2012, and I've done a bunch of neat projects over the years, such as a WhatsApp bot that sends the daily Mishna, an app for my Yeshiva, and a sweet countdown website for my highschool graduation.
