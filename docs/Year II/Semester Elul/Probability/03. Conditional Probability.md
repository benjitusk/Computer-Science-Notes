#### Definition
<u>Conditional Probability</u> is the probability of A *if* B occurs. Denoted by $P(A|B)$.

> [!example] A Die Is Rolled
> Let A be the event of rolling greater than a three.
> Let B be the event of rolling an even number.
> $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
> We are told that B happens. *Now* what is the probability of A?
> ---
> $\Omega_{\text{new}}=\{2,4,6\}$
> Given our $\Omega_{\text{new}}$, $A_{\text{new}}=\{4,6\}$
> 
> $$\frac{|A_{\text{new}}|}{|\Omega_{\text{new}}|}=\frac23$$

### The Formula
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

> [!example]  Reuven Has 2 Children
> Let A be the event that Reuven has exactly 2 boys.
> Let B be the event that Reuven has *at least* one boy.
> Given that Reuven has at least one boy, what is the probability of Reuven having 2 boys?
> ---
> Applying The Formula, $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$
> Since $A\subseteq B$, $\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{\frac14}{\frac34}=\frac13$
> 
> $$\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac13$$

### Independent Events
Events $A$ and $B$ are <u>independent events</u>  if $P(A|B)=P(A)$
(Meaning, if knowing $B$ happened has no effect on the probability of $A$.)
#### Properties of Independent Events
1. Independence is *mutual*.
	- If $P(A|B)=P(A)$, then $P(B|A)=P(B)$.
2. $A, B$ are independent $\iff P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$
	- This extends to $n$ mutually independent events.

> [!caution] Don’t mix this up with disjoint events!
> Disjoint events are **not** the same thing as independent events.
> 
> In fact, if $P(A),P(B)\not=0$, then if they are disjoint $A,B$ **must** be dependent.


### Evaluating Conditional Probabilities

> [!example] Example
> $A=$ I visit New York
> $B=$ I visit the Statue of Liberty
> ![[03. Conditional Probability 2023-08-25 17.40.04.excalidraw]]
> Given $P(A)=0.7$ and $P(B|A)=0.4$, what is $P(B)$?
> ---
> $P(B)=P(B\cap A)$ because $B\subseteq A$.
> By definition: $P(B|A)=\frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(A)}$.
> Multiplying both sides by $P(A)$ gives us:
> 
> $$\begin{align}P(B\cap A)&=P(A)\cdot P(B|A)\\P(B\cap A)&=0.7\cdot 0.4&=0.28\\P(B\cap A)&=P(B)&=0.28\end{align}$$

### Law of Total Probability (LTP)
###### Introductory Example

> [!example] Given 2 jars
> 
> ![[03. Conditional Probability 2023-08-26 20.45.35.excalidraw]]
> 
> The probability of picking jar 1 is $\frac14$, and picking jar 2 is $\frac34$. A ball is selected at random from the chosen jar. What is the probability that I select a blue ball?
> 
> Define events:
> 
> $$\begin{align}A_1&=\text{Choose jar }1\\A_2&=\text{Choose jar }2\\B&=\text{Choose a blue ball}\\\end{align}$$
> 
> We know $P(A_1)=\frac14$, $P(A_2)=\frac34$.
> $P(B\mid A_1)=\frac23$, $P(B\mid A_2)=\frac13$.
> So, how do we find $P(B)$?
> 
> Note that $B=(B\cap A_1)\cup(B\cap A_2)$, which are disjoint events.
> $B\cap A_1\subseteq A_1$, hence, $P(B\cap A_1)=P(A_1)\cdot P(B\mid A_1)$
> $B\cap A_2\subseteq A_2$, hence, $P(B\cap A_2)=P(A_2)\cdot P(B\mid A_2)$
> 
> $$\begin{align}P(B)&=P(B\cap A_1)&+&P(B\cap A_2)\\&=P(A_1)\cdot P(B\mid A_1)&+&P(A_2)\cdot P(B\mid A_2)\\&=\frac14\cdot\frac23&+&\frac34\cdot\frac13\\\\&=\frac5{12}\end{align}$$

Let $A_1,\dots A_n$ be disjoint events which partition $\Omega$.
Let $B$ be any event.
Then:

#### The Law
$B$ is the union of the intersection of $A_k$ and $B$, for all $k$: 
$B=(B\cap A_1)\cup(B\cap A_2)\cup\dots\cup(B\cap A_n)$
Then,

$$P(B)=\sum_{k=1}^n{P(A_k)\cdot P(B|A_k)}$$


#### Proof
**This is very likely on the #ProbabilityExam**
