#### Definition
A <u>random variable</u> (r.v.) is a probability space in which the outcomes are possible values of a variable (denoted by a capital letter: $X,Y,Z…$)

> [!example] Example
> $X=$ number of dots on a roll of a single die
> $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
> 
> $Y=$ number of dots on a roll two dice
> $\Omega=\{2,\dots,12\}$
> 
> $Z=$ number of times die is rolled until it lands on a 3
> $\Omega=\Bbb N_+$
> 
> $W=$ weight of newborn baby in kg.
> $\Omega=[1,4]$ ==note that this is an *interval*, not distinct values==
> 
> $X,Y,Z$ are discrete random values — countable (finite or subset of $\Bbb N$)
> $W$ is a continuous r.v., the possible values form a continuous interval

The <u>probability function</u> $f_x(k)$ of a discrete rv $X$ gives the probability of X assuming each of its possible values, ie $f_x(k)=P(X=k)$


> [!example] Title
> X=roll of die
> $f_X(2)=P(X=2)=\frac16$
> $f_Y(2)=P(Y=2)=\frac1{36}$


Since all outcomes $X=k$ are disjoint and their union (over all possible values $k$) is omega, $P(\Omega)=\sum_kP(X=k)$

$$\sum_kP(X=k)=1$$
