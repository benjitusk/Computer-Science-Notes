Required proofs:
“Calculate the expected value $E[X]$ or prove that it doesn’t exist”
“Calculate the variance $V(X)$ or prove that it doesn’t exist”
“Prove $V(X)=E[X^2]-E[X]^2$”
“Formulate and prove the Law of Total Probability and Bayes’ Law.”
“Prove the formula for $V(X+Y)$”

(Don’t worry, I’ll make this page much nicer later this week bli neder)


$$\begin{aligned}
&P(\text{sum}>10\mid\text{no 1 shek coins picked})\\
\\=&\frac{P(\text{sum}>10\text{ without 1 shek coins})}{P(\text{no 1 shek coins picked})}\\
\\=&\frac{{5\text{ non-1-shek coins}\choose2\text{ arbitrary coins}}\cdot\overbrace{(\frac15)}^{\text{one non arbitrary coin (10NIS)}}}{\frac1{12}\text{ (from part a)}}
\\=&\frac{2}{\frac1{12}}=24????
\end{aligned}$$
