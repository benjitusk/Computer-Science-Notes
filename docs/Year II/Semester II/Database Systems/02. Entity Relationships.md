## Entities

**Definition:** Entity
> An Entity is a **unique** object in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects. An entity could be a physical object (e.g. a house), a concept (e.g. a customer), or an event (e.g. a sale). An entity is described using a set of attributes.
>
> In an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), an entity is represented by a rectangle with the entity name written inside. The name of the entity is usually a singular noun.

**Definition:** Entity Set
> An Entity Set is a collection of similar entities. An entity set is a set of entities of the same type that share the same properties, or attributes.

**Definition:** Attribute
> An Attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity. An attribute describes some aspect of the entity that is of interest to the organization. For example, a customer entity might have attributes such as customer ID, name, address, and phone number.
>
> All entities in an entity set have the same attributes, but the values of these attributes may vary from entity to entity. An attribute must be a single non-null value.
>
> In an ERD, an attribute is represented by an oval with the attribute name written inside. The name of the attribute is usually a singular noun.

**Definition:** Key Attribute
> A Key Attribute is an attribute that uniquely identifies an entity within an entity set. A key attribute is used to distinguish one entity from another. For example, a customer entity might have a customer ID attribute that is used to uniquely identify each customer.
>
> Each entity set must have at least one key attribute. A key attribute must have a unique value for each entity in the entity set, and it cannot have a null value.
>
> An entity set may have more than one key attribute, in which case the combination of key attributes is used to uniquely identify each entity.
>
> Key attributes are underlined in an ERD to indicate that they are key attributes.

## Relationships

**Definition:** Relationship
> A Relationship is an association between two or more entities. A relationship describes how entities are related to each other. For example, a customer entity might be related to an order entity through a relationship called "places." This relationship indicates that a customer places an order.
>
> In an ERD, a relationship is represented by a diamond shape with the relationship name written inside. The name of the relationship is usually a verb phrase.

**Definition:** Relationship Set
> A Relationship Set is a collection of similar relationships. A relationship set is a set of relationships of the same type that connect entities in an entity set.

**Definition:** Recursive Relationship Set
> A Recursive Relationship Set is a relationship set in which the same entity set participates more than once in different *roles*. A recursive relationship set is used to model relationships between entities of the same type.
>
> For example, an employee entity might be related to another employee entity through a relationship called "reports to." This relationship indicates that one employee reports to another employee.
>
> In an ERD, the different roles of the same entity set in a recursive relationship set are identified using role names on the relationship lines.

> [!note] Relationships can have attributes too!
>
> **Definition:** Relationship Attribute
> > A Relationship Attribute is an attribute that describes some aspect of a relationship between entities. A relationship attribute is used to capture additional information about the relationship. For example, a relationship between a customer and an order might have a relationship attribute called "order date" to capture the date the order was placed.

> Like any other attribute, a relationship attribute must be a single non-null value.

<!-- N-ary relationship sets -->
**Definition:** N-ary Relationship Set
> An N-ary Relationship Set is a relationship set that involves more than two entity sets. An N-ary relationship set is used to model relationships between multiple entities.
