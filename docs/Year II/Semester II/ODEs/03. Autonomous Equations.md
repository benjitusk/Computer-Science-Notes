### Slope Field
**Definition:** Slope Field
> A slope field is a tool we can use to learn information about the solutions to an ODE even when we cannot solve it completely.
> Using ODE, we look at many points in the plane and calculate the slope of a tangent to any solution $y(x)$ at that point. By doing this for many points, we can see what graphs of solutions look like.

### Autonomous Equations
An ODE is autonomous if it is in the form $y‚Äô=f(y)$.
For example, 
- $y'=‚àíy^2$
- $y'=4ùë¶(1‚àíùë¶)$
What does the slope field of an autonomous equation look like?
Since $y‚Äô$ depends only on y, the slope of any solution is *constant* along any horizontal line.

Given the ODE $y‚Äô=-y^2$, we can find the slopes for any given y:

| $(x,y)$ | $y‚Äô=-y^2$ |
| ------- | --------- |
| $(2,1)$ | $-1$      |
| $(1,2)$ | $-4$      |
| $(3,0)$ | $0$       |

> [!note]
> An autonomous ODE is a type of separable ODE, so we have an equilibrium solution $y=k$ for any $k$ satisfying $f(k)=0$.
> 
> In our example, $f(0)=0$, so $y=0$ is an equilibrium solution to this ODE.

#### Actual Solutions to the ODE
For the ODE $y‚Äô=-y^2$:

The equilibrium solution is $y=0$.

To solve:

$$-\frac{1}{y^2} y' = 1 \implies \int -\frac{1}{y^2} \, dy = \int 1 \, dx$$

$$\frac{1}{y} = x + C \implies y = \frac{1}{x + C}$$

Here, the uniformity of the slope along each horizontal line is very clear, because each solution $y = \frac{1}{x + C}$ is a right/left translation of the graph $y = \frac{1}{x}$.

```desmos-graph
y = \frac{1}{x + C_1}
y = \frac{1}{x + C_2}
y = \frac{1}{x + C_3}
C_1=-1
C_2=0
C_3=1
```

#### Sketching Solutions of an Autonomous ODE
$y‚Äô=f(y)$
We‚Äôll be using the equation $y‚Äô=4y(1-y)$.

1. Sketch the equilibrium solutions $y=k$ for each root $k$ of $f$
	1. $4y(1-y)=0$
		- $y=1$ 
		- $y=0$
	2. ![[Excalidraw/03. Autonomous Equations 2024-05-30 20.08.33.excalidraw]]
2. Sketch (on a separate pair of axes) the graph of $f(y)$ as a function of $y$, or at least investigate where $f$ is positive/negative, increasing/decreasing, and find the extreme points.
	1. Sketch the function as $y=4x(1-x)$
	2. Find the roots (we already did this in step one)
		- 1, 0
	3. Examine the expanded form $y=-4x^2+4x$
	4. Identify the extreme points
		1. 2<sup>nd</sup> derivative is $y=-8x+4 \implies -8(x-\frac12)$
		2. Root of 2<sup>nd</sup> derivative is $x=\frac12$
	5. Graph is a ‚Äúfrowning‚Äù parabola, so our extreme point is a maximum
