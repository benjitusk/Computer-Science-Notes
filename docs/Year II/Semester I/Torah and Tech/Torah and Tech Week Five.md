**Prohibited Sources (ii) – Severing Connection with the Source:**
In the previous week, the discussion revolved around whether cultured meat, derived from stem cells, could potentially be considered kosher if the original source of those cells was kosher. However, it's noted that cultured meat isn't simply a mass of stem cells; they undergo several stages of differentiation, transforming into something different from their original state. The question then arises: Does this transformation sever the halachic connection to the original source, rendering the final product kosher?

1. **That which Emerges from a Non-Kosher Source (היוצא מן הטמא):**
   - The Mishna cited serves as a basis for the argument that if something emerges from a non-kosher source, it is deemed non-kosher itself. However, this depends on whether the connection between the source cells and the final product remains intact.
   - While discussions of genetic manipulation were absent in earlier halachic discussions, questions about natural transformations were addressed by Rishonim.

2. **"Blood is Spoiled and Becomes Milk":**
   - The discussion in the Gemara explores the idea that blood, considered the "fluid of life," could be transformed into other substances, like milk.
   - The applicability of this concept to other scenarios, like cultured meat, remains a subject of debate.

3. **An Egg and a Chick from a Non-Kosher Bird:**
   - The discussions regarding the prohibition of consuming offspring from non-kosher sources involves debates about the status of eggs and chicks from such sources.
   - There's a discussion about whether the process of hatching, which involves the destruction of the egg, creates a new entity disconnected from its original source.
   - Rambam's ruling regarding the permissibility of a chick hatched from a non-kosher egg underscores the notion that the species (min) of the offspring is what determines its status.
