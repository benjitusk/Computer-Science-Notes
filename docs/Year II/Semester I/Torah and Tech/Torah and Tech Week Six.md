### The Search for Alternative Sources - Poultry

- **Halachic Considerations:**
  - **Entrepreneurial Ventures:** Some entrepreneurs sought alternative sources for stem cells to avoid debates regarding those harvested from live animals. These sources are closely connected to gestation and pregnancy stages, rich in stem cells.
  - **Halachic Need and Biological Advantage:** While the halachic requirement alone might not have been a sufficient incentive, some alternatives offer biological advantages.

### The Status of Eggs

- **Egg Origins:** 
  - **General Principle:** Every animal embryo has the potential for life. Birds lay both fertilized and unfertilized eggs.
  - **Stem Cell Extraction:** Stem cells can be extracted from fertilized, unhatched eggs, potentially used for cultured meat production.

- **Halachic Analysis:**
  - **Rav's Opinion:** According to Rav, once the egg is laid, it is "completed," implying it is parev (neither dairy nor meat).
  - **Debate Clarification:** The debate surrounding this issue delves into whether an egg found within a slaughtered hen is considered meat or parev.

- **Tosafot's Interpretation:**
  - **Rabbeinu Nissim's View:** Eggs are considered parev because they are not classified as meat.
  - **Rabbeinu Tam's Perspective:** There is ambiguity about the status of the eggâ€”whether it's considered part of the animal or already laid, influencing its kashrut status.

- **Alternative Views:**
  - **Tosafot's Interpretation:** Suggests different reasons for permitting eggs, including specific scriptural wording and considering eggs as mere secretions.
  - **Rabbi Isaac HaLevi's Perspective:** Eggs of both pure and impure birds are prohibited due to potential contamination, with differing opinions on the scriptural basis for this prohibition.

### Fertilized Eggs:

1. **Reasons for Permitting Eggs with Milk:**
   - Either eggs are not considered meat inherently, or there's a specific decree permitting them with milk, which itself is subject to another decree.

2. **Halakhic Status of Fertilized Eggs:**
   - Concerns arise from the moment they are laid until the chick hatches.
   - Gemara in Temura 31a suggests a point in the hatching process where the egg becomes permitted.

3. **Blood on the Yolk:**
   - Until the egg's connection to the hen's body is severed, it's considered part of it (fleischig).
   - After separation, it becomes parev unless blood is found on the yolk, indicating fertilization.
   - Blood might only be visible days after laying.

4. **Blood Prohibition:**
   - Mishna in Keritot suggests certain types of blood are not subject to karet.
   - Debate exists on whether blood found in a fertilized egg is prohibited.

5. **Ties to Ashkenazi Tradition:**
   - A tradition relates blood in the egg to whether it's recognizable as part of the chick's formation.
   - This tradition's alignment with Rashi's commentary in Keritot is questioned.

6. **Rabbi Yosef Shaul Natansohn's Perspective:**
   - Rabbi Natansohn suggests that meat separated from a living animal is forbidden, but an egg separated from a hen may not be.
   - He argues that while meat is forbidden for Jews due to "torn flesh in the field," eggs may not be forbidden for non Jews.

7. **Paradox and Potential Applications:**
   - Raises questions about the permissibility of blood cells in fertilized eggs compared to muscle tissue.
   - Raises the possibility of using blood cells as a source material for kosher food if they are not under the same prohibition as meat.

### Mere Secretion:

1. **Exploring Secretions:**
   - Secretions have been assumed not to be prohibited, raising the possibility of using cells from them for cultured meat production via genetic engineering.
   - Raises questions about whether such engineered cells could circumvent existing prohibitions.

2. **Talmudic Perspectives:**
   - Talmudic sources discuss the purity of various secretions.
   - Rav Sheshet and Rabbi Yaakov debate whether urine might be prohibited if occasionally consumed.
   - Disagreements among the Sages are highlighted through discussions on the permissibility of honey.

3. **Rulings and Interpretations:**
   - The Rosh rules stringently on secretions, unsure if it might constitute a Torah prohibition.
   - The Shulchan Arukh follows the Rosh but cites dissenting opinions, such as that of the Rambam, who permits urine for certain purposes.
   - Rabbi Yehonatan Eibschitz and Rabbi Yoav Yehoshua Weingarten offer interpretations to explain the Rambam's leniency regarding urine.

4. **Interpretative Debates:**
   - Rabbi Gross suggests that according to the Rambam, only substances directly linked to the body's functioning are prohibited.
   - Raises questions about the preferability of the explanations for the Rambam's leniency and whether Rabbi Gross's conclusion necessarily follows without codification in the Shulchan Arukh.
