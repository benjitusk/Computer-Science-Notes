### The Nutrients: Halachic Implications

1. **Rav Zev Weitman's Perspective:**
   - Rav Weitman considers the nutrients as the primary factor in determining the kosher status of cultured meat.
   - He compares the growth medium to soil, suggesting that just as soil nourishes plants, the nutrients nourish the cells, and if the nutrients are kosher, the cultured meat is permissible.

2. **Rav Mordechai Gross's Perspective:**
   - Rav Gross disagrees, stating that the growth medium does not create a new reality like soil does for plants.
   - He argues that since the growth medium itself does not cause growth but merely provides suitable conditions, even if the source of the stem cells is permissible, the cells grown on a non-kosher medium would still be prohibited.

3. **Rabbi Asher Weiss's Consideration:**
   - Rabbi Weiss suggests that serum might be permissible, likening it to צללתא דדמא (clot of blood) mentioned in the Talmud.
   - If serum qualifies as צללתא דדמא, it might affect the halachic status of the cultured meat produced in it.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Each approach has its merits: Rav Weitman focuses on the end product's kosher ingredients, while Rav Gross emphasizes the medium's direct involvement in the growth process.
   - The consideration of serum as צללתא דדמא adds another layer of complexity to the discussion, potentially impacting the final ruling on the cultured meat's kosher status.

5. **Additional Rabbinic Prohibitions:**
   - Some poskim argue that even if there is no karet punishment for consuming blood plasma, there is still a rabbinic prohibition against it.
### This and That Causes it Jointly

1. **Types of Cultured Meat Products:**
   - **Fat and Muscle Cells:** Produced on an industrial scale and added to plant-derived products.
   - **Complete Muscle Tissue:** Requires scaffolding materials to create pieces of meat like steak or brisket.

2. **Halachic Considerations:**
   - **Equal Contribution:** Some suggest viewing the product as a new entity where both stem cells and nutrients equally contribute (פנים חדשות).
   - **Admixture Perspective:** Alternatively, the product might be seen as an admixture of cells and nutrients, with the scaffolding materials also considered depending on their presence in the final product.

3. **Gemara and Halachic Precedents:**
   - The Gemara concludes that if "this and that caused it," it is permitted, but it also presents cases where prohibitions apply differently based on direct or indirect impact.
   - The Shakh permits food digested within an animal's body, equating it to burnt food, potentially allowing meat from an animal fed prohibited substances.
   - The Ran distinguishes between cases where prohibitions have a direct impact versus indirect benefit.

4. **Halachic Analysis:**
   - **Direct vs. Indirect Impact:** Directly prohibited materials may render the product permissible only after the fact, while indirectly impacted products could be permitted initially.
   - **Stem Cells vs. Nutrients:** Viewing stem cells as the site of differentiation fed by nutrients raises questions about the halachic status of each component.

5. **Nutrients vs. Scaffolding Materials:**
   - **Difference:** Nutrients provide sustenance, while scaffolding materials shape the tissue. The Ran's distinction between direct and indirect impact could affect the halachic status of each.

6. **Further Cases:**
   - Additional cases raise similar considerations, suggesting a need for nuanced analysis in each scenario.

### An Essential Enabling Factor

1. **Talmudic Precedents:**
   - **Curdling Milk:** The Mishnah discusses curdling milk with prohibited substances like orla fruit resin.
   - **Prohibition Factor:** Debated whether the prohibition lies with the stomach or the rennet and what each corresponds to in the context of cultured meat production.

2. **Interpretations:**
   - **Catalyzing Agent vs. Stabilizer:** While the medium catalyzes the curdling process, some poskim refer to it as a stabilizer (דבר המעמיד), implying a different function.

3. **Halachic Application:**
   - **Contemporary Context:** The term "דבר המעמיד" is also used in discussions about gelatin's kashrut status, suggesting its relevance to modern food processing.
- ### Further Discussion: Gelatin

1. **Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzenski:**
   - Raises concerns about the status of gelatin derived from animal bones.
   - Argues that the drying process may remove any trace of the prohibited substance, rendering it permissible.

2. **Rabbi Ovadia Yosef:**
   - Compares gelatin production to the extraction of musk oil, suggesting that initial prohibitions may be nullified through processing.
   - Affirms the permissibility of gelatin consumption based on the transformation it undergoes.

3. **Rabbi Moshe Feinstein:**
   - Asserts that gelatin derived from kosher hides, even if salted, is permissible.
   - Differentiates between gelatin derived from kosher and non-kosher sources, prohibiting the latter.

4. **Rabbi Aharon Kotler:**
   - Questions the permissibility of using gelatin mixed with dairy, emphasizing the potential change in its status based on its composition.
   - Suggests that even if gelatin from kosher sources might be permitted, mixing it with dairy could pose separate halachic concerns.
