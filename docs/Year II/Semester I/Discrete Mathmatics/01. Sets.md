### Sets
##### Definitions, Notations, and Symbols
- A **set** is a collection of *distinct*, unordered elements.
- $\alpha\in A$ means that the element $\alpha$ is contained within the set $A$.
	- $\alpha\not\in A$ is a negation of the above
- A set $T$ is a **subset** of $S$ if every element in $T$ is also in $S$
	- Can be restated as **If the statement “if $x\in T$ then $x\in S$” is true, then…**
	- Denoted $T\subseteq S$
	- $T\not\subseteq S$ is a negation of the above
	- Both sides of the $\subseteq$ symbol must be sets
	- Every set is a subset of itself
- A set $T$ is a **proper subset** of $S$ if $T\subseteq S$ and $T\not= S$
- The **empty set** is the set containing no elements.
	- Denoted as $\set{}$ or $\phi$ (Greek letter phi)
	- It is a subset of *every* set, other than itself


> [!example] Set syntax and examples
>
> - $S=\set{2, 3} = \set{3, 2}$
> - $S=\set{1,2,3,\dots,100}$
> 	- Not recommended, it’s very ambiguous
> - $S=\set{n\le100\mid n\in\N}$
> 	- Vertical line ($\mid$) means “such that”, or “where”
> 	- $\N$ is the set of natural numbers
> - $S=\set{2,4,6,\dots,58}$
> 	- The set of even numbers from 1 to 58
> 	- Not recommended, very ambiguous,
> 	- These formats are more preferable:
> 		- $\set{2n\mid n\in\N,\ n\le29}$
> 			- The comma indicates an additional condition
> 			- We want to minimize the number of conditions
> 		- $\set{n\mid n\in\N,\ n\text{ even}}$

#### Important Sets to Know
- $\N$
	- The set of all natural numbers
	- Integers **greater than and NOT equal to** Zero
	- $\set{1,2,3,\dots}$
- $\Z$
	- The set of all integers
	- $\set{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,\dots}$
- $\Q$
	- The set of all *rational* numbers
	- $\set{\frac mn\mid m,n\in\Z,\ n\neq0}$, if you’re fancy
- $\R$
	- The set of all real numbers

#### Set Operations
- Union — $A\cup B$
	- Returns a set containing elements that are in either or both sets
	- Commutative and associative
	- If $A\subseteq B$ then $A\cup B=B$
	- For all sets $A,B$: $A\subseteq A\cup B$, and $B\subseteq A\cup B$
- Intersection — $A\cap B$
	- Returns a set containing elements that are strictly in both sets
	- Commutative and associative
	- If $A\subseteq B$ then $A\cap B=A$
	- For all sets $A,B$: $A\cap B\subseteq A$, and $A\cap B\subseteq B$
	- Conclusion:
		- $A\cap B\ \subseteq A\subseteq \ A\cup B$
		- $A\cap B\ \subseteq B\subseteq \ A\cup B$
- Difference — $A - B$ or $A \setminus B$
	- Returns a set containing all of the elements in $A$ that were not found in $B$
	- Not commutative or associative
- Symmetric Difference — $A\bigtriangleup B$ or $A\oplus B$
	- Returns a set containing all of the elements in either $A$ or $B$, but not both
	- Commutative and associative, surprisingly
	- $A\oplus B = (A\cup B) - (A\cap B)$
- Complement — $\setcomp A$ or $A^\mathsf{c}$
	- Often, every set we consider is seen as a subset of a larger set, called the **universal set**, such as $\N$ or $\R$. We denote this universal set as $U$.
	- For any set $A$, $\setcomp A$ is the set of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$.
	- $\setcomp A = U - A$

##### Properties of Set Operators
1. $A\cap(B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$
2. $A\cup(B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)$
3. $\setcomp{A\cup B}=\setcomp A\cap\setcomp B$
4. $\setcomp{A\cap B}=\setcomp A\cup\setcomp B$
#### Venn Diagrams
I found this material to be useful but not worth me drawing up my diagrams. If you would like to send me a diagram to put in here, create a diagram using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), and send me the link to the diagram. I will add it to the notes and credit you.

#### Proofs
How to formally prove that $A=B$?
Proofs must use 2-directional inclusion, i.e:
$A=B$ iff $A\sseq B$ and $B\sseq A$.
We must show that both of the following are true:
- If $x\in A$, then $x\in B$
- If $x\in B$, then $x\in A$.

#### Power Set
**Definition:** The **power set** of a set $S$ (denoted $\pset S$) is the set of all subsets of $S$.

> [!example] Power Set Examples
>
> $A=\set{1,2}$
> $\pset A=\set{\set{},\set{1},\set{2},\set{1,2}}$
> $\pset A=\set{\phi,\set{1},\set{2},\set{1,2}}$, alternatively

For any set $S$, $\phi\in\pset S$ and $S\in\pset S$.

> [!warning] Remember!
>
> The only elements of a power set are sets.
> There will be no elements of a power set that are not sets.
>
> $\set{1}\in\pset{\set{1,2}}$, but $1\notin\pset{\set{1,2}}$

##### Power Set Theorem
For any finite set $S$, $|\pset S|=2^{|S|}$, where $|S|$ is the number of elements in $S$.

This means that the number of elements in the power set of a set is equal to $2$ raised to the number of elements in the set.
