#### Services and Protocols
- Transport segment from sending host to receiving host
	- Sender: Encapsulates segments from the Transport Layer into datagrams, and passes them on to the Link Layer
	- Receiver: Delivers segments to the Transport Layer protocol.

**Routers** examine header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it, and move datagrams from input ports to output ports to transfer datagrams along their end to end path.

#### Two key network layer functions
- **Forwarding**: Move packets from a router’s input link to the appropriate router output link
- **Routing**: Determine the route taken by packets from source to destination

#### Data Plane and Control Plane
##### Data Plane
- Local, per router function
- Determines how datagram arriving on router input port is forwarded to the router output port
##### Control Plane
- Network-wide logic
- Determines how datagram is routed among routers along end-to-end path from the source to the destination host.
- There are two Control Plane approaches:
	- Traditional routing algorithms, implemented in routers
	- Software Defined Networking (SDN), implemented in remote servers

##### Protocol Field
Has a dedicated value for the protocol being used. 
- Transport Layer Protocols
	- TCP
	- UDP
- Network Layer Protocols
	- ICMP
	- IGMP
	- OSPF

#### Fragmentation Field
Can either be set to Do not Fragment, or More Fragments

1 $\forall x(P(x) \to M(x))$
2 $\forall x(P(x)) \to M(x)$
