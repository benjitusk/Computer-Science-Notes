#### Transport Services and Protocols
Their job is to provide logical communication between application processes running on different hosts.
The sender breaks the [[02. Application Layer#Messages|application messages]] into *segments*, and passes those to the Network Layer.
The receiver reassembles segments into messages, and returns them to the Application Layer.

There are two Transport Protocols available to Internet applications:
- **TCP**
- **UDP**
