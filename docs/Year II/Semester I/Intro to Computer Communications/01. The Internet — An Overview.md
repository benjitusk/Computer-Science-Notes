#### The Internet
The Internet is made up of billions of connected computing devices.
A **host** is an end system running network apps at the Internet’s “edge”. Data only enters/exits the Internet via edges. Internally, no “new” data is generated.
A **packet switch** forwards packets, which are chunks of data.
Examples of packet switches are routers and switches.
Communication links are the methods which are used to transfer data
Examples of comm links are fiber, copper, radio, satellite.
A **network** is a collection of devices, routers, and links, managed by an organization.

Really, the Internet is a network of ISP[^1]s.
