#### Definitions
Let $R$ be a relation from $A$ to $B$ ($R\subseteq A\times B$)
**Definitions:**
The **domain** of $R$ is the set $\set{a\in A\mid\exists b\in B \ s.t. (a,b)\in R}$.
The **image** of $R$ is the set $\set{b\in B\mid\exists a\in A \ s.t. (a,b)\in R}$.

> Let $A=\set{1,2,3}$
> Let $B=\set{10,12,18,20}$
> $R=\set{(\textcolor{red}{1},\textcolor{green}{12}),(\textcolor{red}{1},\textcolor{green}{20}),(\textcolor{red}{3},\textcolor{green}{10}),(\textcolor{red}{3},\textcolor{green}{12})}$

> The **domain** of $R$ is $\set{\textcolor{red}{1},\textcolor{red}{3}}$
> The **image** of $R$ is $\set{\textcolor{green}{10},\textcolor{green}{12},\textcolor{green}{20}}$

A relation $R$ is called **single valued** if the following is true:

- If $(a,b)\in R$ and $(a,c)\in R$, then $b=c$.
    - Alternatively, for every $a\in A$, there is at most one $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in R$.

**Definition:**
A relation $f\subseteq A\times B$ is called a **function** from $A$ to $B$ (denoted $f:A\to B$) if $f$ is single valued and the domain of $f$ is $A$.

> [!example] Example of a Function
>
> Let $A=\set{1,2,3}$
> Let $B=\set{10,12,18,20}$
> Let $f_1:A\to B$. $f_1=\set{(1,10),(2,18),(3,10)}$
> Let $f_2:A\to B$. $f_2=\set{(3,12),(2,10),(1,18)}$
>
> (We write $f_1(2)=18$, $f_2(3)=12$, etc.)

Clearly every $f:A\to B$ consists of exactly 3 pairs.
Intuitively: A function $f$ is a “machine” taking in input and yielding output.
Another way of saying this is that it maps values of $A$ to values of $B$.

Two functions $f,g$ are equal only if they have the same domain, the same range, *and* $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain.

**Definition:**
$f:A\to B$ is called **one-to-one** (or **injective**) if whenever $a_1\neq a_2$, then $f(a_1)\neq f(a_2)$.
Alternatively, **If $f(a_1)=f(a_2)$, then $a_1=a_2$**.

> [!example] Example of a One-to-One Function
> In examples $f_{1,2,3}$ above, $f_3$ is one to one, but not $f_1$ or $f_2$.

**Definition:**
$f:A\to B$ is called **onto** (or **surjective**) if for every $b\in B$, there is some $a\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$.

> [!tip] One to One and Onto in plain English
> - One to One: Every output has a unique input.
> - Onto: Every output has at least one input.

**Definition:**
If $f:A\to B$ is both one-to-one and onto, then $f$ is called a **bijection** (or **one-to-one correspondence**).
For example, $f_3$ is a bijection.

The **identity function** on $A$ (where $f_{I_A}(a)=a$) is trivially a bijection.

### Composition of Functions
Let $f:A\to B,g:B\to C$.

**Definition:**
The **composed function** $(g\circ f):A\to C$ is defined as follows:
For each $a\in A: (g\circ f)(a)=g\left(f(a)\right)$
![[Excalidraw/03. Functions 2024-01-25 12.47.12.excalidraw]]
Note:
1. This is exactly composition of relations, applied to functions.
2. Note reverse notation: Though $f$ is applied to $g$, we write $g\circ f$.
	1. $(g\circ f)(a)$ is G of F of a

> [!example] Example of Composed Functions
>
> Let $f,g:\R\to\R$.
> $f(x)=x^2+3$
> $g(x)=2x-5$
>
> $(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x^2+3)=2(x^2+3)-5=2x^2+1$
>
> $(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))=f(2x-5)={(2x-5)}^2+3=4x^2-20x+28$

Note from this example, composition of functions is **not commutative.**
$f\circ g \not= g\circ f$ in general.

However, function composition is associative.
E.g., let $f,g,h:\R\to\R$. $(h\circ(g\circ f))(x)=((h\circ g)\circ f)(x)$.

If $f:A\to B$, $g:B\to C$, are both one-to-one, then $g\circ f$ is one-to-one.

If $f:A\to B$, $g:B\to C$, are both onto, then $g\circ f$ is onto.


### Invertibility
**Definition:**
$f:A\to B$ is **left invertible** if there is some $g:B\to A$ such that $g\circ f = I_A$.

![[Excalidraw/03. Functions 2024-01-25 13.17.36.excalidraw]]

We call $g$ a **left inverse** of $f$.

**Definition:**
$f:A\to B$ is **right invertible** if there is some $g:B\to A$ such that $f\circ g = I_B$.

![[Excalidraw/03. Functions 2024-01-25 13.20.59.excalidraw]]

We call $g$ a **right inverse** of $f$.


> [!important]
> $f:A\to B$ is left invertible if and only if $f$ is one-to-one.

> [!important]
> $f:A\to B$ is right invertible if and only if $f$ is onto.

> [!important]
> $f:A\to B$ is invertible if and only if $f$ is a bijection.

In this case, there is a *unique* function $g:B\to A$ such that $g\circ f = I_A$ and $f\circ g = I_B$. (I.e., $g$ is both a left and right inverse of $f$.)

We call $f$ an **invertible function** and $g$ the **inverse function** of $f$ (denoted $f^{-1}$).

Note: if $f$ is invertible, then $f^{-1}$ is invertible, and ${(f^{-1})}^{-1}=f$.
