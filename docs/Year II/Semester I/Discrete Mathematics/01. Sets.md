## Sets
#### Definitions, Notations, and Symbols
- A **set** is a collection of *distinct*, unordered elements.
- $\alpha\in A$ means that the element $\alpha$ is contained within the set $A$.
	- $\alpha\not\in A$ is a negation of the above
- A set $T$ is a **subset** of $S$ if every element in $T$ is also in $S$
	- Can be restated as **If the statement “if $x\in T$ then $x\in S$” is true, then…**
	- Denoted $T\subseteq S$
	- $T\not\subseteq S$ is a negation of the above
	- Both sides of the $\subseteq$ symbol must be sets
	- Every set is a subset of itself
- A set $T$ is a **proper subset** of $S$ if $T\subseteq S$ and $T\not= S$
	- Denoted as $T\subset S$
- The **empty set** is the set containing no elements.
	- Denoted as $\set{}$ or $\phi$ (Greek letter phi)
	- It is a subset of *every* set, other than itself

> 	- Vertical line ($\mid$) means “such that”, or “where”
> 	- $\N$ is the set of natural numbers
> - $S=\set{2,4,6,\dots,58}$
> 	- The set of even numbers from 1 to 58
> 	- Not recommended, very ambiguous,
> 	- These formats are more preferable:
> 		- $\set{2n\mid n\in\N,\ n\le29}$
> 			- The comma indicates an additional condition
> 			- We want to minimize the number of conditions
> 		- $\set{n\mid n\in\N,\ n\text{ even}}$

### Important Sets to Know
- $\N$
	- The set of all natural numbers
	- Integers **greater than and NOT equal to** Zero
	- $\set{1,2,3,\dots}$
- $\Z$
	- The set of all integers
	- $\set{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,\dots}$
- $\Q$
	- The set of all *rational* numbers
	- $\set{\frac mn\mid m,n\in\Z,\ n\neq0}$, if you’re fancy
- $\R$
	- The set of all real numbers

### Set Operations
- Union — $A\cup B$ 
	- Returns a set containing elements that are in either or both sets
	- Commutative and associative
	- If $A\subseteq B$ then $A\cup B=B$
	- For all sets $A,B$: $A\subseteq A\cup B$, and $B\subseteq A\cup B$
- Intersection — $A\cap B$ 
	- Returns a set containing elements that are strictly in both sets
	- Commutative and associative
	- If $A\subseteq B$ then $A\cap B=A$
	- For all sets $A,B$: $A\cap B\subseteq A$, and $A\cap B\subseteq B$
	- Conclusion:
		- $A\cap B\ \subseteq A\subseteq \ A\cup B$
		- $A\cap B\ \subseteq B\subseteq \ A\cup B$
- Difference — $A - B$ or $A \setminus B$ 
	- Returns a set containing all of the elements in $A$ that were not found in $B$
	- Not commutative or associative
- Symmetric Difference — $A\bigtriangleup B$ or $A\oplus B$ 
	- Returns a set containing all of the elements in either $A$ or $B$, but not both
	- Commutative and associative, surprisingly
	- $A\oplus B = (A\cup B) - (A\cap B)$
- Complement — $\setcomp A$ or $A^\mathsf{c}$ 
	- Often, every set we consider is seen as a subset of a larger set, called the **universal set**, such as $\N$ or $\R$. We denote this universal set as $U$.
	- For any set $A$, $\setcomp A$ is the set of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$.
	- $\setcomp A = U - A$

#### Properties of Set Operators
1. $A\cap(B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$
2. $A\cup(B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)$
3. $\setcomp{A\cup B}=\setcomp A\cap\setcomp B$
4. $\setcomp{A\cap B}=\setcomp A\cup\setcomp B$
### Venn Diagrams
I found this material to be useful but not worth me drawing up my diagrams. If you would like to send me a diagram to put in here, create a diagram using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), and send me the link to the diagram. I will add it to the notes and credit you.

### Proofs
How to formally prove that $A=B$?
Proofs must use 2-directional inclusion, i.e:
$A=B$ iff $A\sseq B$ and $B\sseq A$.
We must show that both of the following are true:
- If $x\in A$, then $x\in B$
- If $x\in B$, then $x\in A$.

### Power Set
**Definition:** The **power set** of a set $S$ (denoted $\pset S$) is the set of all subsets of $S$. 

> [!example] Power Set Examples
>
> $A=\set{1,2}$
> $\pset A=\set{\set{},\set{1},\set{2},\set{1,2}}$
> $\pset A=\set{\phi,\set{1},\set{2},\set{1,2}}$, alternatively

For any set $S$, $\phi\in\pset S$ and $S\in\pset S$.

> [!warning] Remember!
>
> The only elements of a power set are sets.
> There will be no elements of a power set that are not sets.
>
> $\set{1}\in\pset{\set{1,2}}$, but $1\notin\pset{\set{1,2}}$

#### Power Set Theorem
For any finite set $S$, $|\pset S|=2^{|S|}$, where $|S|$ is the number of elements in $S$.

This means that the number of elements in the power set of a set is equal to $2$ raised to the number of elements in the set.

### Infinite Unions and Intersections
- Unions: $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$ 
	- The union of all sets $A_i$ for $i=1,2,3,\dots$
	- The set of all elements that are in at least one of the sets $A_i$
	- In English: “The union of $A_i$ for all $i$”
	- Example: $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty\set{i}=\N$
	- Example: $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty[\frac1i,\frac1{i+1})=(0,1]$
		- Explanation: The union of all intervals $[\frac1i,\frac1{i+1})$ for $i=1,2,3,\dots$ is the interval $(0,1]$ (open on the left, closed on the right)
- Intersections: $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i$
	- The intersection of all sets $A_i$ for $i=1,2,3,\dots$
	- The set of all elements that are in every one of the sets $A_i$
	- In English: “The intersection of $A_i$ for all $i$”
	- Example: $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty\set{i}=\set{1}$
	- Example: $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty[\frac1i,\frac1{i+1})=\set{0}$
		- Explanation: The intersection of all intervals $[\frac1i,\frac1{i+1})$ for $i=1,2,3,\dots$ is the set $\set{0}$ because the only number that is in every interval is $0$.

### Cartesian Products
**Definition:** An **ordered pair** is a pair of elements $(a,b)$ in which the order of the elements matters. $(a,b)\not=(b,a)$. 

**Definition:** An **ordered n-tuple** is an ordered list of $n$ elements $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$ in which the order of the elements matters. $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\not=(a_2,a_1,\dots,a_n)$.

Familiar examples of ordered pairs and ordered n-tuples:
- Point in the plane: $(x,y)$
- Point in space: $(x,y,z)$

**Definition:**
Let $A, B$ be sets. The **Cartesian product** of $A$ and $B$ (denoted $A\times B$) is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. 

Formally, $A\times B=\set{(a,b)\mid a\in A,\ b\in B}$

> [!example] Cartesian Product Example
>
> $A=\set{\textcolor{red}{1},\textcolor{orange}{2}}$
> $B=\set{\textcolor{green}{3},\textcolor{pink}{4},\textcolor{lightblue}{5}}$
>
> $$A\times B=\set{(\textcolor{red}{1},\textcolor{green}{3}),(\textcolor{red}{1},\textcolor{pink}{4}),(\textcolor{red}{1},\textcolor{lightblue}{5}),(\textcolor{orange}{2},\textcolor{green}{3}),(\textcolor{orange}{2},\textcolor{pink}{4}),(\textcolor{orange}{2},\textcolor{lightblue}{5})}$$
>
> Note how each element of $A$ is paired with each element of $B$.


#### Properties of Cartesian Products
- Unlike previous set operations ($\cup,\cap,\setcomp\ , \setminus$ ), the elements of $A\times B$ are *new* elements, not elements of $A$ or $B$.
	- $A\cap (A\times B)=\phi$
- The product is **not** commutative
	- In general, $A\times B\not=B\times A$
- For finite sets $A,B$, $|A\times B|=|A|\cdot|B|$

#### Distributivity of Cartesian Products
1. $A\times(B\cup C)=(A\times B)\cup(A\times C)$
2. $A\times(B\cap C)=(A\times B)\cap(A\times C)$
