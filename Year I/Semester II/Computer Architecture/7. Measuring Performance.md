### Important Terms
- CPU: Central Processing Unit — Contains the ALU
	- I really hope this isn’t news to you
- Clock Rate (CR)— The rate at which the CPU internal clock runs. It is measured in cycles per second (Hz).
- Clock Cycle (CC) — The length of a single cycle. This is the inverse of the clock rate.
	- $CC=\frac1{\text{Clock Rate}}$
	- CC is usually measured in microseconds ($1\times10^{-6}$ seconds), but sometimes milliseconds ($\times10^{-3}$) or nanoseconds ($\times10^{-9}$)
- Instruction Count — The number of instructions in a given program
- Cycles Per Instruction — The number of clock cycles required to perform the entire program divided by the instruction count. 
	- Basically, average cycle per instruction
- CPI<sub>i</sub> — The number of cycles required to perform an [[1. Instruction Types#I-Type|I-Type]] instruction.
