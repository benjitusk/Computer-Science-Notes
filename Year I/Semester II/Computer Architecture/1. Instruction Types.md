## I-Type

![[Notes 2023-07-09 15.27.48.excalidraw|600]]
The offset value is a signed 16-bit number in 2â€™s compliment.
Examples of I-type:
- `lw`
- `sb`
- `beq`
- `andi`

## J-Type

![[Notes 2023-07-09 15.31.37.excalidraw|600]]
The only two J-type instructions are `j` and `jal`.
These commands work by extending the address by 2 bits (multiplying by four) and appending it to the most significant four bits of the PC (after incrementing), and then setting the PC to that address.

## R-Type

![[Notes 2023-07-09 15.32.17.excalidraw|600]]
The opcode for all R-type commands is 0.

`RS`, `RT`, `RD` stand for Registers Source, Target, and Destination. The order can be remembered with the mnemonic S.T.D., which stands for Sexually Transmitted Disease, or Simchaâ€™s To Do (app), whichever suits your fancy. Yeah, that mightâ€™ve been gross and unnecessary, but trust me, now youâ€™re definitely not going to forget the order any time soon. ðŸ™ƒ

`ShAmt` is short for Shift Amount. This value is only used for the shift commands: `sll`, `srl`, and `sra`.

The function field tells the ALU what operation to do. We need this, since the opcode is zero. More on this later.
