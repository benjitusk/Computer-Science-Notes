There are three to five cycles for any given command (other than floating point), similar to Single Cycle:
1. Fetch
2. Decode
3. Execute
4. Memory
5. Register Write

Each stage is performed in one clock cycle.

### Fetch
This instruction is identical for all command types.
The address from the PC is passed to the Memory File. The Memory File reads the data at that address, and is stored in a temporary Instruction Register, to be used later as the instruction to execute. The PC is incremented by 4.

### Decode
The values from the specified registers (RS and RT) are passed into temporary registers (called A and B) to make sure the data persists across the next cycle. The Control sets the control lines according to the opcode. 

Just in case the command is a Branch command, we calculate what the destination address is. The bottom 16 bits are sign extended to 32 bits and shifted left two bits. The ALU adds the PC to this value and stores the result in the ALUout register

### Execute
The ALU uses the values in registers A and B as it’s operands. Depending on the instruction, one of four things happen:
- R-Type instructions
	- The ALU performs an operation on A and B, storing the result in ALU-Result
- Memory instructions (`sw`/`lw`)
	- ALU calculates effective memory address by adding the offset to RS
- Branch instructions
	- ALU subtracts B from A to see if they’re equal, and sets the zero flag accordingly
- Jump instructions
	- The PC is set to the 4 leading bits of the PC (after incrementing it by 4) and the 28 bits of the shifted address
	- ![[Notes 2023-07-09 18.15.04.excalidraw|600]]

All instructions other than Load, Store, and R-Types complete here.


### Memory Access
- R-Type
	- The result calculated in the Execute cycle is waiting in the ALUout register. This value is written to register RD.
- Store word/byte
	- The address computed in the Execute cycle is passed from ALUout to the Write Address line into the Memory File, and the contents of RT are passed to the Write Data line of the Memory File. The Control unit sets the MemWrite line to 1.
- Load word/byte
	- The address computed in the Execute cycle is passed from ALUout to the Read Address line into the Memory File. The Control unit sets the MemRead line to 1. The result is stored in the Memory Data register to persist across the next cycle.

### Register Write
This stage only happens with load commands. The data in the Memory Data register is sent to the Register File and written to RT.
