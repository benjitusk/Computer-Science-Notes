Unfortunately I couldn’t get my Markdown → HTML exporter to play nice with PDFs, so here’s a link[^1] to the sheet. It’s double sided, and it has just about everything you’ll need for the exam. If you have any requested modifications, reach out to him or me on WhatsApp.

[^1]: I’m waiting on Yehuda to upload the sheet to the drive. Once he does, I’ll come back and put the link in. Cheers!
