### General Concepts
- What is probability?
	- It’s a measure of how likely *something* is to happen
- Terminology
	- An <u>experiment</u> is some occurance which can turn out in multiple ways
		- Rolling dice
		- flipping coins
		- anything in a random manner
		- weather
	- An <u>outcome</u> is a discrete result of a given experiment.
	- The set of all possible outcomes is called the <u>sample space</u>, denoted as $\Omega$
		- Eg., Rolling a die, $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
		- Eg., Flipping a coin, $\Omega=\{H,T\}$
		- Rolling 2 dice — more complicated, it depends what you want.
			- Sum of rolls: $\Omega=\{2,3,4,\dots,12\}$
			- Distinct results: 
	- An <u>event</u> is a subset of $\Omega$
		- It’s a set of possible outcomes.
			- Eg, rolling a single die < 6
				- $S=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
